# FinancialTracker
CPSC 362 - Software Engineer Project: FinancialTracker is a financial analysis tool that implements a web scraper to create a Django REST Framework. The data stored is used for visualization and algorithmic predictions of the individual stocks. The final product will be a web application done in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and React. 

## Getting Started

First, to get started on deployment you must clone the github repository. In order to login to the Django API you have to create a superuser by the cmd 'python manage.py createsuperuser' (may require 'winpy python manage.py createsuperuser' on Windows). When created, run the server using 'python manage.py runserver' and the default host is https://localhost:8000/admin.

### Prerequisites

To run the application you will need Python installed along with the following:

```
pip install django
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example

until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
